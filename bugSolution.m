The solution uses a weak-strong pattern to handle the potential deallocation of self in `delayedMethod`. This pattern keeps a strong reference while the method is executing, preventing unexpected deallocation. 

```objectivec
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface MyObject : NSObject
- (void)myMethod;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)myMethod {
    __weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self; // Create a weak reference
    dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(5.0 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ 
        __strong typeof(weakSelf) strongSelf = weakSelf; // Create a strong reference before accessing self
        if (strongSelf) {
            [strongSelf delayedMethod];
        }
    });
}

- (void)delayedMethod {
    NSLog(@"Delayed method executed successfully.");
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
        [obj myMethod];
        // To allow the program to continue running for the delay
        [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runUntilDate:[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:6.0]];
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This improved version uses `dispatch_after` for better clarity and avoids the potential issues of `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` related to the runtime environment.

By using a weak reference to self within the `dispatch_after` block and a strong reference inside the block when the delayed task is executed, we ensure that `delayedMethod` only executes if `self` is still alive. If `self` has been deallocated, the condition `if (strongSelf)` will be false, preventing the crash.
